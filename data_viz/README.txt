	The code of the entire project is stored in index.html, as well as any references to the outside material. 

		For the project, we have used both references to the code and our own code. The "Most Common Disorders," "Employer's Mental Health Attitudes," and "How Can we Fit the Situation?" graphs were developed with reference to the examples online. All examples online are cited within index.html file, within it's corresponding <script> parts. The tooltip of the "Hear the Voices" was also developed with help of reference.

	The js folder contains the downloaded js libraries (such as jQuery) that were used in the project.

	The data folder contains all the *copies* of the data files that we have been using for the project. However, we ended up referring to the data hosted on Google Drive for the visuals, as there were issues with d3 reading from the local files. Thus, the actual data is being used is either hard-coded into d3 code (retrieved from preprocessing) or refers to a .csv on the Google Drive. The .ipynb file in the directory is a Jupiter Notebook file that contains all of the code used for preprocessing the data. 

	The image files in the folder are used in index.html.
